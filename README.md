# Flutter and GraphQL App
The Flutter and GraphQL App is a full-stack mobile application developed using Flutter for the front-end and a Node.js server powered by GraphQL, Express, and MongoDB on the back-end. This project showcases the efficient use of GraphQL APIs for managing complex data relationships such as authors, books, readers, and their reviewsâ€”all while delivering a responsive and structured UI through Flutter.

This app allows users to perform a variety of operations like adding and viewing authors, books, and readers, and managing detailed book reviews. Designed as a learning and practice tool, it highlights how to structure and query nested relationships with GraphQL, making it ideal for developers who want to explore GraphQL-powered Flutter applications.
